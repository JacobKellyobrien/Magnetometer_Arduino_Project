# magnetometer_project
A small magnetometer arduino project which measures the magnetic field using a LIS2MDL, and saving this data to a excel file via an online SD card
The project uses a LIS2MDL magnetometer, an Adafruit Grayscale 1.5inch 128x128 OLED display, a RP2040 adalogger by adafruit, a VL53L4CX Time of flight sensor, and a PCF8523 real time clock.
